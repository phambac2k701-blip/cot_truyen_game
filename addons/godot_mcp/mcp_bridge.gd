extends Node
## WebSocket client inside the editor plugin (issue #3; direction inverted in #276).
##
## Connects OUT to the MCP server's bridge listener (default ws://127.0.0.1:9080) and
## reconnects with backoff whenever the link is down — the editor is the party that
## comes and goes, so it owns reconnection (see docs/architecture.md). Pumps the peer
## every frame in _process: parse JSON command envelopes, dispatch through
## MCPCommandRouter, and send back JSON response envelopes. Optional shared-token
## auth (issue #538): when GODOT_MCP_BRIDGE_TOKEN is set, the FIRST message after
## connect authenticates the editor ({command: cmd_auth, params:{token}}); a
## mismatch gets a structured refusal and this side drops into its normal
## reconnect/backoff loop (the dock log shows the refusal reason each attempt).
##
## API verified against the Godot 4 docs (class_websocketpeer): WebSocketPeer
## connect_to_url / poll / get_ready_state (STATE_CONNECTING/OPEN/CLOSING/CLOSED) /
## get_available_packet_count / get_packet / send_text (see .opencode/rules/addon.md).

## Mirrors MCPStatusDock.ConnectionStatus ordering so the plugin can map directly.
## REPLACED (#593) is appended last so the existing 0/1/2 mapping is unchanged:
## it means this editor's link was taken over by another editor and the server
## sent the PEER_REPLACED notice — every command now goes to that other editor.
